If, within twenty-four (24) hours after a completion of a ride, a Rider does not identify a specific Donation amount for such ride, or decline to donate by specifying Rs. 0 as the Donation amount, Jugnoo will assume that the Rider selects the suggested Donation amount for the ride and the Rider's credit card will automatically be charged that amount.

				"\n"+"HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION"+"\n"+
				"We use Your email address and Your other personal information to help Us efficiently operate the Jugnoo Platform, to contact You in connection with Your transactions and other activities on the Jugnoo Platform (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or important news that could affect Your relationship with Jugnoo), to forward trip information to You from other Users, to forward trip information from You to other Users, and to contact You and others to suggest potential matches.

				"To operate the Jugnoo Platform, including processing Your transactions and supporting Your activities on the Jugnoo Platform, We may share Your personal information with Our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide Us with support services such as email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services, and order fulfillment.

				"\n"+"HOW WE USE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA"+"\n"+
				"We may review all demographic Data. We may use public information to enable other users to search Your profile, to determine whether Your trip details fit other user's requirements, and to communicate with You. We may use demographic information to tailor the Jugnoo Platform and communications to Your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers Your identity). One of the reasons We may do this is to increase the likelihood that Our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to You as a user of the Jugnoo Platform. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., We do not tell advertisers which particular Jugnoo Users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy.

				"Jugnoo provides Users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from Us and Our partners at the point where We request information about the visitor. Jugnoo gives Users the option to remove their information from Our database, to not receive future communications or to no longer receive Our service."+"\n"+
				"\n"+"SPECIAL CASES IN WHICH WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION"+"\n"+
				"Your personal information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy.
